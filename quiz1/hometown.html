                    I was born and raised in Palembang city, sumatera selatan. It may not be the most
                    beautiful place I've ever been but this place always had a place in my heart.</br>
                </br>
                    This city actually didn't have much of open space. It has no beach, no hills,
                    and mountains nearby. People usually go to mall to entertain themself, or for some
                    social climbers they'll go to expensive cafe.</br>
                </br>
                    The People in my city are usually kind and helpful, we sometimes greed each other
                    even though we never met before.
