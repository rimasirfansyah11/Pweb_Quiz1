                    Palembang's finest local food is "Pempek".</br>
                </br>

                </br>
                    The food taste so good. With the fish as ingredients, it may be a little smelly,
                    but don't let it fool you for the food itself tastes great. It is crispy outside, 
                    but squishy inside and also have so many different stuffing.
