                    Actually there are not much to see in this citty.</br>
                </br>
                    But, doesn't mean this city has no tourism destination. For example, there is 
                    a bridge called Ampera, museum called Monpera, big al-qur'an sculpture called
                    Al-qur'an Al-akbar.
                </br>
                </br>
                    I believe there is a lot more tourism destination in this city because i don't 
                    explore the tourism location in my city, that's because i don't have much time.
